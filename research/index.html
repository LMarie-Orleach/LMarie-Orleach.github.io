	  <h3>Quantification of pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection</h3>
	  <p>Sexual selection may occur before, during, and after copulation. I have used a powerful model organism, the flatworm 
             <i>Macrostomum lignano</i>, in which I could study sperm competition <i>in vivo</i> (Marie-Orleach et al, <i>BMC Evol 
	     Biol</i>, 2014), and quantify the strength of selection acting along pre- and postcopulatory episodes of selection 
	     (Marie-Orleach et al, <i>Evolution</i>, 2016; Marie-Orleach et al., <i>Evol. Lett.</i>, 2021). This body of work 
	     overall showed that, despite being usually cryptic, postcopulatory sexual selection may be a more important
	     agent of selection than pre-copulatory sexual selection. </p>

	  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Transgenesis in <i>Macrostomum lignano</i> allowed me to measure components of <br>
		  sperm competition <i>in vivo</i> along which I measured multivariate selection on sperm traits.</figcaption>
	  
	  <h3><br>Inidrect genetics effects on sex allocation</h3>
	  <p>Copulation is not always a harmonious union between sexual partners. Conflicts of interests may arise and lead to a 
             sexually antagonistic co-evolution between traits manipulating partners and traits resisting these manipulations. In <i>
             Macrostomum lignano</i>, individuals can affect the postcopulatory behaviours of their partners (Marie-Orleach et al., 
             <i>Anim. Behav.</i>, 2013), and the size of their testes (Marie-Orleach et al., <i>Evolution</i>, 2017) – and these effects
	     differ among genotypes. Such socially induced plasticity, or indirect genetic effects, are increasingly recognised to play
	     critical roles in driving phenotypic evolutionary trajectories (Bailey et al, <i>Behav. Ecol.</i>, 2018).</p>
	  
	  <h3><br>Plasticity of sexual isolation</h3>
	  <p>Sexual isolation between closely related species is usually though to be innate. However, the traits underpinning 
		  reproductive barriers are often found to be socially plastic, and such plasticity would affect the evolution 
		  of reproductive isolation. Using several populations and species of in the <i>Drosophila</i> genus, I showed 
		  whether males are reared with homo- or heteropopulation males does not affect neither their courtship song 
		  (Marie-Orleach et al., <i>Ecol. Evol.</i>, 2019), nor the strength of pre- and postcopulatory components of 
		  sexual isolation (Marie-Orleach, <i>Behav. Ecol.</i>, 2020). Thus, although male sexual traits are highly plastic, 
		  this plasticity does not seem to affect the strength of sexual isolation.</p>

	  <h3><br>Role of sexual selection on speciation</h3>
	  <p>Sexual selection is often considered an engine of speciation, but the empirical evidence are surprisingly scarce 
		  and challenging to obtain. Using meta-analyses, we show that species richness correlates with the strength of 
		  male sexual selection (Janicke et al., <i>Proc. B.</i>, 2018), but not with the strength of assortative mating 
		  (Janicke et al., <i>Am. Nat.</i>, 2019), suggesting that sexual selection, and not assortative mating, promotes 
		  speciation.</p>
	  
	  <h3><br>Effects of self-fertilisation on speciation</h3>
	  <p>Simultaneously hermaphroditic species vary greatly in how much the self-fertilise. Selfing rates is well known to
		  affect several key population genetics parameters, which may affect rates of speciation, but this is poorly 
		  understood. I build population genetics models to clarify how reproductive isolation builds in selfing compared
		  to outcrossing lineages (Marie-Orleach et al., <i>BioRxiv</i>, 2022), providing predictions on the genetic 
		  architecture and pace of speciation testable in crossing experiments (Gustafsson et al., <i>Ann. Bot.</i>, 
		  2022).</p>
